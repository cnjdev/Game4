### Star Wars RPG

This is a simple RPG Game where Characters Battle until one is left standing.

To begin the game, select a Player.  Then select Defenders to fight with. When a Player and Defender are chosen, the Fight begins...

A Fight ends when the Player or the Defender are defeated. If the Player is defeated, the game is over. If the Defender is defeated, choose another Defender to fight.  If there are no more Defenders to defeat, the game is won!

With each round, the Player's attack grows stronger as the Defender's attack remains the same. Choose the order of Defenders wisely!

Game was built using JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, Bootstrap.
